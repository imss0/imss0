### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer from KoreaðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· with a solid track record in a startup. 

I came to the UKðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ to challenge myself and prove my ability to survive in a whole new environment.
I'd say it is one of the ways I'm getting out of my comfort zone :D

### Tech
I mainly work with ![react](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-61DAFB.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=React&logoColor=black) ![typescript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-3178C6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=TypeScript&logoColor=white) ![javascript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=JavaScript&logoColor=black) ![nextjs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tailwind%20CSS-06B6D4.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Tailwind-CSS&logoColor=white) ![express](https://img.shields.io/badge/Express-000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Express&logoColor=white)
