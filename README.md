### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer from Korea ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·

I came to the UKðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ to challenge myself and prove my ability to survive in a whole new environment.
I'd say it is one of the ways I'm getting out of my comfort zone! :D

### Tech
I mainly work with ![angular](https://img.shields.io/badge/Angular-DD0031?style=for-the-badge&logo=angular&logoColor=white) ![react](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-61DAFB.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=React&logoColor=black) ![typescript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-3178C6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=TypeScript&logoColor=white) ![nextjs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next.js-000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=nextdotjs&logoColor=white)
